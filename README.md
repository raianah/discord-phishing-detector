- I am Detective, and I detect and delete phishing links! My main goal is to protect your server from unwanted scam attacks and possible exploits of phishing links. With over 9,300 links registered in my list, I can track every single one of them and delete it immediately until someone else sees!
- With the code fully open source, you can also create your own phishing detector in your server! All you need to do is to clone this repository, provide your own discord bot token and other necessary API keys, and run it via VPS or any server hosting you prefer, and you're good to go.

## Additional Information
- Written in [disnake 2.4.0](https://pypi.org/disnake/).
- Has domain/URL checker via VirusTotal.
- Virus leaderboards via SQLite.

## How to Clone Repository?
- You can't as of now as it is undergoing a rewrite.
